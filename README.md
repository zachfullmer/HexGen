# HexGen

A hex-based map generator!

The map is generated from a set of overlapping simplex noise maps that denote height, rainfall, drainage, and temperature. The hexes are then given a biome type based on these values. The app loads its resources (sprites and animations) from [darkFunction Editor](http://darkfunction.com/editor/) animation files.

The hexagon tile sprites were drawn by a friend, and are a work in progress.
